  abstract = {The lambda-Pi-calculus allows to express proofs of minimal
              predicate logic. It can be extended, in a very simple way, by
              adding computation rules. This leads to the lambda-Pi-calculus
              modulo. We show in this paper that this simple extension is
              surprisingly expressive and, in particular, that all functional
              Pure Type Systems, such as the system F, or the Calculus of
              Constructions, can be embedded in it. And, moreover, that this
              embedding is conservative under termination hypothesis.},

              Helm team at the University of Bologna. Its stable version 0.5.x
              may be downloaded at http://matita.cs.unibo.it. The tool originated
              in the European project MoWGLI as a set of XML-based tools aimed to
              provide a mathematician-friendly web-interface to repositories of
              formal mathematical knoweldge, supporting advanced content-based
              functionalities for querying, searching and browsing the library.
              It has since then evolved into a fully fledged ITP, specifically
              designed as a light-weight, but competitive system, particularly
              suited for the assessment of innovative ideas, both at foundational
              and logical level. In this paper, we give an account of the whole
              system, its peculiarities and its main applications.",
