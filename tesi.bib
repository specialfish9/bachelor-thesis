  abstract = "The lambda-Pi-calculus allows to express proofs of minimal
              predicate logic. It can be extended, in a very simple way, by
              adding computation rules. This leads to the lambda-Pi-calculus
              modulo. We show in this paper that this simple extension is
              surprisingly expressive and, in particular, that all functional
              Pure Type Systems, such as the system F, or the Calculus of
              Constructions, can be embedded in it. And, moreover, that this
              embedding is conservative under termination hypothesis.",
